The following problems **do not** represent the kind of question expected to feature in a Higher Mathematics exam, either in the way they are presented or the level of difficulty. Instead, they aim to encourage a flexible approach towards problem-solving and an understanding that the skills covered in the course have applications beyond those featured in any typical exam. *Some questions may be solveable without using the skills covered in this chapter, and some questions may be unreleated to this chapter.*
